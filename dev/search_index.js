However, don't be discouraged: there is a reason for everything. I'll explain not only how we can work around the lack of objects, but also to embrace it!

I know this skips over the origin and abstract concepts around objects as they were found in the Smalltalk language, but that is besides the point. OOP as we know it is mostly designed around a mostly  antiquated run-time involving pointers and vtables. What I'm getting at, is that the abstractions in a language are often very much guided by the underlying run-time implementation. That means that in C++ the idea of classes makes sense. In Python we already have a very different view of an object, as everything is based around objects being hashmaps with some commonly understood interface. In Julia, having such a different run-time, multiple dispatch makes sense. Quite similar to the idea that the kind of music we make or hear depends on the setting in which it is staged (opera house without electric amplification, a living room setting, a noisy café or earbuds on a daily commute) and the available technology, more so than other cultural considerations. Meanwhile, we have entire schools of thought on how to organise code and design architectures around larger code bases.
